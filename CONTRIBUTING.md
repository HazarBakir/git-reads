## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment. We expect all contributors to:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully

## Getting Started

Before contributing, please:

1. Read through the [README.md](README.md) to understand the project
2. Check the [existing issues](https://github.com/HappyHacingSpace/git-reads/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/HappyHacingSpace/git-reads/pulls)
3. Review the [roadmap](#feature-roadmap) in the README to understand planned features

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or higher
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Initial Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/git-reads.git
   cd git-reads
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Copy environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. Configure environment variables in `.env`:
   - `VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN`: Optional, increases API rate limits
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Required for local session testing
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Required for local session testing

### Database Setup (Optional)

Database setup is only required if you need to test session management or highlight features locally:

1. Create a free account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Navigate to SQL Editor in your dashboard
4. Execute the SQL files in `supabase/migrations/` in order:
   - `init_schema.sql`
   - `highlights.sql`
5. Get your credentials from Project Settings → API
6. Add them to your `.env` file

Note: All pull requests are automatically deployed to Vercel with full database access for complete feature testing.

### Running Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
